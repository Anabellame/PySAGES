"""
Umbrella Integration.

Umbrella integration uses multiple replicas placed along a pathway in the free energy
landscape by Harmonic Bias simulations.
From the statistics of the simulations, the thermodynamic forces along the path are
determined and integrated to obtain an approximation of the free energy landscape.
This class implements the replica simulations and approximates the free energy.
However, the method is not very accurate and it is preferred that more advanced methods
(e.g. the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method) are used for the analysis of the simulations.
